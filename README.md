# Phono

With 'Phono', HIFI enthusiasts can create their analog vinyl record collection as a digital version for searching out their tonight's listening pleasure in advance, seeing the value change on the marketplace and sharing their collection with friends.

### This is where you can take a look and test the app:

- [Heroku](https://phono-app.herokuapp.com)

Test login data:

Username: PhonoUser\
Password: Checkin123456789

## Installing / Getting started

First, install dependencies: `npm install`

In the project directory, you can then run:

`npm run build` : Builds the app for production to the dist folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

`npm start` : Runs the server in production mode and serve production bundle from npm run build

The default PORTS are:

- `3001` for the server
- `3000` for the client
- `6006` for the storybook

If you don't like to call all scripts at once, you can also run:

```shell
npm run dev-server
npm run dev-client
npm run storybook
```

## Tests

A test runner is not installed (right now). But TypeScript, linter and prettier are checked on commit and push thanks to husky and lintstaged.
